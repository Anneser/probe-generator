# HCR Probe Generator

The **HCR Probe Generator** is a full-featured, browser-based tool to design HCR v3.0 probe sets based on user-supplied cDNA sequences. It enables researchers and students to generate probes with optimal hybridization properties and biological relevance, with optional off-target filtering using BLAST.

## üöÄ Features

- Accepts any sense-strand cDNA sequence
- Select from multiple amplifier initiators (B1, B2, ..., B17)
- Filters out homopolymer-rich regions
- Computes Tm, GC%, and CDS coverage per probe
- Prioritizes probes within the coding sequence (CDS)
- Avoids overlapping probe pairs
- Scores and ranks candidate probes by biological and thermodynamic criteria
- Optional BLAST filtering against transcriptomic FASTA
- Generates:
  - IDT-compatible CSV for oPool ordering
  - Annotated GenBank file
  - Coverage plot
  - Probe summary table with all computed metrics

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Gene name        | Any identifier for your gene                           |
| cDNA sequence    | Sense-strand DNA, no headers/spaces                    |
| Amplifier type   | Choose one of B1‚ÄìB17                                   |
| Pause            | Offset from 5' before first probe is allowed           |
| PolyN thresholds | Max allowable length of poly-A/T or poly-C/G stretches |
| Tm / GC filters  | Set bounds and ideal target for probe evaluation       |
| Min spacing      | Minimum distance between probe pair starts             |

## üß™ BLAST Filtering (Optional)

- Input any FASTA-formatted transcriptome or gene set
- BLASTn-short is used internally
- You can choose to:
  - See good/bad hits
  - Drop flagged probes with weak or ambiguous matches

## üì¶ Outputs

- **IDT oPool CSV**: Split oligos with shared pool name
- **GenBank file**: Probe + CDS annotations for viewing in ApE
- **Interactive Plot**: Visual layout of all probe sets
- **Summary Table**: Tm, GC%, position, CDS status for each probe
